        <h2>
            What is artificial intelligence?
        </h2>
        <p>
        While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades,<br>
        John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside<br>
        IBM), " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer<br>
         programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI<br>
        does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."  <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted<br>
        by Alan Turing's seminal work, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (PDF, 89.8 KB) (link resides outside<br>
         of IBM), which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the "father of computer<br>
          science", asks the following question, "Can machines think?"  From there, he offers a test, now famously<br>
           known as the "Turing Test", where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and <br>
        human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since its publish, it remains an important<br>
     part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around <br>
     linguistics.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach <br>
        (link resides outside IBM), becoming one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve<br>
         into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems on the basis of <br>
         rationality and thinking vs. acting: <br>
         <b>Human approach:</b> <br>

          Systems that think like humans <br>
          Systems that act like humans <br>
          <b>Ideal approach:</b> <br>

          Systems that think rationally <br>
            Systems that act rationally <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Alan Turing’s definition would have fallen under the category of “systems that act like humans.” <br>

            At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust <br>
             datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep <br>
         learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines <br>
         are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications <br>
          based on input data. <br>
            
        Today, a lot of hype still surrounds AI development, which is expected of any new emerging technology in <br>
        the market. As noted in Gartner’s hype cycle (link resides outside IBM), product innovations like, self-driving <br>
       cars and personal assistants, follow “a typical progression of innovation, from overenthusiasm through a <br>
        period of disillusionment to an eventual understanding of the innovation’s relevance and role in a market <br>
         or domain.” As Lex Fridman notes here (01:08:15) (link resides outside IBM) in his MIT lecture in 2019, <br>
          we are at the peak of inflated expectations, approaching the trough of disillusionment.   <br>
            
        As conversations emerge around the ethics of AI, we can begin to see the initial glimpses of the trough of <br>
        disillusionment. To read more on where IBM stands within the conversation around AI ethics, read more <br>

            Types of artificial intelligence—weak AI vs. strong AI<br>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Weak AI—also called Narrow AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)—is AI trained and focused to <br>
            perform specific tasks. Weak AI drives most of the AI that surrounds us today. ‘Narrow’ might be a<br>
             more accurate descriptor for this type of AI as it is anything but weak; it enables some very robust<br>
           applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, IBM Watson, and autonomous vehicles.<br>

            Strong AI is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).<br>
           Artificial general intelligence (AGI), or general AI, is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would<br>
            have an intelligence equaled to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability <br>
            to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)—also known as <br>
           superintelligence—would surpass the intelligence and ability of the human brain. While strong AI is<br>
            still entirely theoretical with no practical examples in use today, that doesn't mean AI researchers <br>
            aren't also exploring its development. In the meantime, the best examples of ASI might be from science<br>
           fiction, such as HAL, the superhuman, rogue computer assistant in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  <br>

            Deep learning vs. machine learning

        </h1>
        <p>
            Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the <br>
             nuances between the two. As mentioned above, both deep learning and machine learning are sub-field <br>
              of artificial intelligence, and deep learning is actually a sub-field of machine learning. <br>
