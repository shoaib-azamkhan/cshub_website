            For many people, information technology (IT) is basically synonymous with the guys<br>
            and gals you call when you need help with a computer issue. While that view of <br>
            information technology isn’t totally wrong, it drastically understates the scope of<br>
            this critical career field.<br><br>

            If you’re looking to get a better handle on what information technology is and the <br>
            many facets of this field, then you’ve come to the right place. We’ve done the<br>
            digging for you and spoke with IT industry pros to create this helpful beginner’s<br> 
            guide to the field.<br>

        </p>
        <h2> 
          * What is information technology and what does it encompass?<br><br>
        </h2>
        <p>
           The most basic information technology definition is that it's the application of<br>
           technology to solve business or organizational problems on a broad scale.No <br>
           matter the role, a member of an IT department works with others to solve technology<br>
           problems, both big and small.<br>

            There are three primary pillars of responsibility for an IT department:<br>
            
           <b> IT governance:</b> This refers to the combination of policies and processes that ensure<br>
            IT systems are effectively run and in alignment with the organization’s needs.<br>
            <b>IT operations:</b> This is a catchall category for the daily work of an IT department.<br>
            This includes providing tech support, network maintenance, security testing and <br>
            device management duties.<br>
           <b> Hardware and infrastructure:</b> This focus area refers to all the physical components<br>
            of IT infrastructure. This pillar of IT includes the setup and maintenance of <br>
            equipment like routers, servers, phone systems and individual devices like laptops.<br>
            Even though an organization’s IT department handles many different functions and<br>
            plays a critical role in keeping things running, Andrey Prokopchuk, head of IT at<br>
            Belitsoft, says the perfect IT department is the one you aren’t even aware of. <br>
            This means that they are able to automate and create processes for many of their <br>
            daily tasks, so that the business continues to run smoothly. The ideal IT department<br>
            is also aligned with the business’s goals and transparent in its processes in a way <br>
            that the rest of the business can understand and provide input on. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>
           * Why is information technology important?
        </h2>
        <p>
           Simply put, the work of most organizations would slow to a crawl without functioning<br>
            IT systems. You’d be hard-pressed to find a business that doesn’t at least partially<br>
            rely on computers and the networks that connect them. Maintaining a standard level<br>
            of service, security and connectivity is a huge task, but it’s not the only<br>
            priority or potential challenge on their plates.<br>

            More and more companies want to implement more intuitive and sophisticated <br>
            solutions. “IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and <br>
            out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security<br>
            Officer and technology blogger. Let’s take a look at the needs that current <br>
            and future IT specialists will be working on:<br>
            Based on the volume of these needs, you probably won’t be too surprised to learn<br>
            that employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected<br>
            to grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, which is faster than the average for all<br>
            occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics<br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Hardware vs. software
        </h2>
        <p>
        You know that working with hardware and software is a large part of an IT department’s<br>
        work, but what counts as hardware? And what’s software? Let’s break down this important<br>
        distinction.<br>

        Hardware includes all the physical parts of a computer system. This includes hardware<br>
        installed inside the computer like the motherboard, central processing unit and hard<br>
        drive. Hardware also describes components that can be connected to the outside of a<br>
        computer like a keyboard, mouse and printer. Keep in mind though that some tablets and<br>
        smaller laptops integrate items like a keyboard and a mouse within the device.<br>
        Basically, hardware is any part, component or device related to computers and their<br>
        networks that you can physically touch and manipulate.<br>

        Unlike hardware, software is not something you can physically change.Software encompasses.<br>
        all the data, application and programs stored electronically, like an operating system.<br>
        or a video-editing tool..<br>

        So how does this distinction apply to an IT career? Nearly every IT job requires a.<br>
         blend of hardware and software-based know-how. Some IT workers may spend more time.<br>
        working with configuring hardware components, but those components are also governed.<br>
        by software. Additionally, IT professionals are responsible for deploying and setting.<br>
        up software applications for users..<br>
        </p>

            IT career opportunities:

        </h2>
        <p>
         Now that you know the general responsibilities of an IT department, you may be wondering<br>
        what the individual roles within are. Here are some of the positions that you’ll find<br>
        in many IT departments:<br>
        <b>Computer support specialists:</b> work on the front lines troubleshooting any technology<br>
        issues including software issues, computer crashes and hardware trouble. These specialists<br>
        may also assist senior-level IT members with larger-scale network issues.<br>
        <b>Network systems administrators:</b> focus on the big picture of the network system, security<br>
        and performance.<br>
       <b> Computer systems analysts:</b> work behind the scenes to marry IT with smart business solutions.<br>
        They usually specialize in a particular industry while working for a technology firm<br>
        or work directly in an industry, like finance or government.<br>
        <b>Information security analysts:</b> are responsible for the security of an organization’s computer<br>
        networks, conducting tests and developing company-wide best security practices.<br>
        Keep in mind that some of these roles will change depending on the size and scope<br>
        of the company. In smaller companies, most of your daily work may revolve around<br>
        relatively mundane things like troubleshooting printers, but on the other hand,<br>
        you may be required to be more of a jack-of-all-trades with broader knowledge.<br>
        With large firms, IT employees have a more diverse array of potential focus areas—some<br>
        may work upward into management and strategic planning roles, while others may pursue<br>
        specialized areas like cybersecurity.<br>
