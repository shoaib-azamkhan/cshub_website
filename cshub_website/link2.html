<h1>1.2	Classification of Computers</h1>
Digital Computers are divided into different categories depending on several factors. These include processing power, storage capacity, size of the main memory and several other factors. There are four categories (or size) of computers.
They are:  
 <b>a)	Supercomputers </b>
 <b>b)	Mainframe computers</b>
 <b>c)	Minicomputers     </b>
 <b>d)	Microcomputers or personal computers</b>

Supercomputers:
Supercomputers are the largest existing computers. There are only few supercomputers in the world. These computers are used for specialized applications which require very fast processing.

Mainframe computers:
     Mainframe are also very big computers, but they are smaller  
     Then supercomputers. They are used by major banks, 
     Insurance companies, airlines and large government 
     Departments which need a lot of computing power.
     They are expensive and need several people to operate and 
     Maintain them. They also require a special environment and  
     Can operate only in airconditioned surroundings.

    Minicomputers:
    Minicomputers are used by smaller business; they cost less 
    And need a smaller staff for operation and maintenance. They 
    Are found in smaller institutions like banks, universities and 
    Hospitals.
  
   Microcomputers:
   Microcomputers or, they are commonly called, micros or 
   Personal computers (PC’S) were developed in the late 1970’s 
   Their popularity or wider usage is due to the development in
Microelectronics and the innovation of the microchip. The low cost of the chip has accounted for lower priced computers enabling a larger number of people to use them.
Laptops are also personal computers. Their compact size and light weight makes them portable and easy to carry.
