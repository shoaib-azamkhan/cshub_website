    <h1>  Generations of Computers</h1>
             <p>
Computers, at various stages of their evolution, have been divided into six generations.<br/> 
Every new generations has certain dramatic improvements when compared to its previous<br/> 
generations. These improvements were the result of the technology used for building the<br/> 
computers, programming languages used and the computers systems internal organizations. <br/> 
The six generations of computers are:<br/> 
>> The Mechanical Era (1623-1900)<br/> 
>> First-Generation Electronic Computers (1937-1953) <br/> 
>> Second-Generation (1954-1962)<br/> 
>> Third-Generation (1963-1972)<br/> 
>> Fourth-Generation (1972-1984)<br/> 
>> Fifth-Generation (1984-1990)<br/> 
>> Sixth-Generation (1990-till date)<br/>
