        <b>Computer Science</b> is learning about computers and their uses. The word
         computer has<br> become a very common word and its use is extensive.
         A computer is simply a machine that<br>can solve problems by accepting data
         (input).Performing certain operations on that data<br> (process) and presenting
         the results of those operations (output).<br>

              <h2>  1.1	History of Computers</h2>
                    <p2>
    How did computes come into existence? The history of Computer is quite interesting.<br> 
    Imagine that you have a job where you have to perform nothing but calculations<br> 
    every day—at one point of time you will get bored. You might even become careless<br> 
    and start making mistakes. This is the reason inventors come up with something that<br> 
    would automate the task of performing calculations.<br> 
    The chines abacus was one of the early inventions that helped humans perform mathematical<br> 
    calculations. After the invention of a multitude Of diverse devices such as the Jacquard loom<br> 
    (1805) and Charles Babbage’s “analytical engine” (1834), calculating machines involved  into<br> 
    the modern computers that we see today. In the initial days, when electronic computer devices<br> 
    first come into use, there was much difference of opinion on the relative merits of analog <br> 
    computers over digital computers. In fact, even by the end of the 1960s, only analog putters<br> 
    over digital computers were used for solving systems having finite difference equations.<br> 
    As more time passed users realized that digital computing device had the economics,<br> 
    power and scalability which were needed for dealing with large-scale computations.<br> 
    Starting from simple hand had calculators to supercomputers, today’s world Is dominated <br> 
    by digital computers.  <br>

                      <h2>  Generations of Computers</h2>
                    <p3>
   Computers, at various stages of their evolution, have been divided into six generations.<br> 
   Every new generations has certain dramatic improvements when compared to its previous<br> 
   generations. These improvements were the result of the technology used for building the<br> 
   computers, programming languages used and the computers systems internal organizations. <br> 
   The six generations of computers are:<br> 
        >> The Mechanical Era (1623-1900)<br> 
        >> First-Generation Electronic Computers (1937-1953) <br> 
        >> Second-Generation (1954-1962)<br> 
        >> Third-Generation (1963-1972)<br> 
        >> Fourth-Generation (1972-1984)<br> 
        >> Fifth-Generation (1984-1990)<br> 
        >> Sixth-Generation (1990-till date)<br>
